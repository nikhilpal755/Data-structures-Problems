------------------------- BOYER's MOORE MAJORITY VOTE ALGORITHM -----------------------------
Algo : 
  Step 1 – Find a candidate with the majority –

         -> Initialize a variable say i ,votes = 0, candidate =-1 
         -> Traverse through the array using for loop
         -> If votes = 0, choose the candidate = arr[i] , make votes=1.
         -> else if the current element is the same as the candidate increment votes
         -> else decrement votes.
         
  Step 2 – Check if the candidate has more than N/2 votes –

         -> Initialize a variable count =0 and increment count if it is the same as the candidate.
         -> If the count is >N/2, return the candidate.
         -> else return -1.
         
 INTUTION : 
      When the elements are the same as the candidate element, votes are incremented when some other element is found not equal to the candidate element.
      We decreased the count. This actually means that we are decreasing the priority of winning ability of the selected candidate, since we know that if 
      the candidate is a majority it occurs more than N/2 times and the remaining elements are less than N/2. We keep decreasing the votes since we found 
      some different element than the candidate element. When votes become 0, this actually means that there are the same number of different elements, 
      which should not be the case for the element to be the majority element. So the candidate element cannot be the majority, so we choose the present 
      element as the candidate and continue the same till all the elements get finished. The final candidate would be our majority element.We check using 
      the 2nd traversal to see whether its count is greater than N/2. If it is true, we consider it as the majority element.

        if(cnt > n/2)return majority;
        
        return -1;
